That's it, now that you've correctly configured the script, next i‚Äôll show you how to use it.

## How to use the script?

### Using automation tools such as (Make, Zapier‚Ä¶)

After deploying the script, you will be given a public link to your API.

![Untitled](./assets/8.png)

for example mine is https://notioninvites.d3vlab.workers.dev

To invite a new user, make a **POST** request with the parameters listed below.

**Required**:

`email` the user email that you want to invite

`pageid` your notion page id

**Optional** (default is comment)

`permission` the permission you want to grant to the invitee

**edit ‚Üí** can edit but not share with others

**comment** ‚Üí can view and comment but not edit

**view** ‚Üí cannot edit or share with others

**Example**:

If I want to invite a guest to this page, the request url will be

[https://notioninvites.d3vlab.workers.dev/invite?email=someone@gmail.com&pageid=1e3380fcafc74d74a59e55037982609b](https://notioninvites.d3vlab.workers.dev?email=someone@gmail.com&pageid=1e3380fcafc74d74a59e55037982609b&)

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è make sure you add `/invite` path after the base url

</aside>

In make, for example, you can use the HTTP module and a variable to dynamically specify the user email address.

After you run the workflow, the user will be instantly invited.

## With Gumroad

Gumroad setup is much simpler, simply go to your Gumroad dashboard > settings > advanced and enter your API url followed by `/gumroad` path in the Ping section.

for example mind is:

[https://notioninvites.d3vlab.workers.dev/](https://notioninvites.d3vlab.workers.dev?email=someone@gmail.com&pageid=1e3380fcafc74d74a59e55037982609b&)gumroad

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è Please keep this link private because anyone who obtains it will be able to invite users to your page.

</aside>

1. When you create a product, you must include your Notion `page id` in the link.

That's it, whenever a guest make a new purchase, Gumoard will automatically submit the user information, and the script will invite the user to the page.
